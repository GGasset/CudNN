# Overview
## What?

* CudNN is an AI framework made from scratch using CUDA/C++
* Does not support transformers, and there is no plan for it.
* See [why](#why) to find out the niche of this project.

## Technologies used
### Planned-WIP
 - L1, L2 regularization (Planned)
 - Adam optimizer (Planned)
 - C++ Socket bindings (WIP)
 - [PPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347) Reinforcement Learning Policy Gradient Method used in ChatGPT (Planned)
 - [MinLSTM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01201) Simpler versions of LSTM (Planned)

### Done
 - [GAE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02438) Generalized Advantage Estimator
 - LSTM architecture

## How?
* It has been my 7th iteration on an AI framework, and I wouldn't say I've learnt a lot otherwise, I've learnt a lot.
	* I've learnt how to create scalable solutions thanks to trial-error (Sadly and Proudly).
	* Conditioning is optional, Conditions are controlled, Consistency is key.

## Why?
* CudNN trades inference efficiency for model structure flexibility.
	* That means that continous training and also using evolution methods is faster on CudNN than it is on Tensorflow, you would do that to find an optimal model size.
		* As per my knowledge, to add neurons on Tensorflow in realtime during training, to, lets say, find the most efficient model size for a given task i.e. best structure for hidden layers, you would need to:
    		1. Save the model on disk
    		2. Load it as text
    		4. Modify it
    		5. Save it
    		6. Load into a model (Class).
* CudNN has a WIP client API which doesn't require CUDA compilation, being useful for use with common game engines in which is hard to compile with Cuda.
* In the future, it will feature godot bindings for its socket client, C# bindings for Unity are not planned, UE already uses c++.
